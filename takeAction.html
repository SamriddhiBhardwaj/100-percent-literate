    <h1>TAKE ACTION</h1>
    <p>Each one of us has the power to change the world and there's no better time to act on the issues we care about than NOW! There are  a lot of ways you can take action. But firstly, remember to learn sufficiently about the issue so that you make  informed decisions. It is a good idea to directly get in touch with policy makers by mailing them. Try getting in touch with your senator. Otherwise, inform those around you about the issue by starting a club or an instagram page. If possible,  donate to trust-worthy charities dedicated to the cause.</p>
